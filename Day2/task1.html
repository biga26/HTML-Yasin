    <p> <strong>What is Lorem Ipsum? </strong> <br>
        <b><em>Lorem Ipsum</em></b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard<br> 
        dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br>
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br> 
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with<br>
        desktop publishing software like <i>Aldus PageMaker</i> including versions of <em>Lorem Ipsum</em>.
